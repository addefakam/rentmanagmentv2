Task ID: 1
Agent: Main agent (Super Z)
Task: Produce the master implementation plan document for the Residential House Rent Control and Administration System (Proclamation 1320/2016 + Addis Ababa Directive 7/2016 + Model Rental Agreement), with a named SDLC model, phase-gated roadmap, stage-gate interaction model, and step-by-step owner guide.

Work Log:
- Read all three legal documents fully: Proclamation No. 1320/2016 (32 articles, English), Addis Ababa Directive No. 7/2016 (26 articles, 6 parts, Amharic, 17 pages incl. annexed model contract), Model Rental Agreement (8 sections + signature/witness blocks).
- Loaded docx skill chain completely: SKILL.md -> routes/create.md -> references/design-system.md -> references/common-rules.md -> references/docx-js-core.md -> references/toc.md -> scenes/report.md.
- Locked outline (12 chapters) via Outline tool; document type word, GO-1 palette.
- Key design decision extracted from Directive: three working administrative tiers (Woreda front desk -> Sub-city aggregation -> Bureau regulation) under Federal Ministry; system designed as national platform with per-city configuration.
- Chose and named SDLC model: Hybrid Phase-Gated Incremental (V-Model verification + Agile sprint construction), 9 phases (P0-P8), 10 gates (G0-G9).
- Wrote generation scripts: scripts/plan_lib.js (helpers, R1 cover, GO-1 tokens), plan_content_a.js (ch 1-3), plan_content_b.js (ch 4-6), plan_content_c.js (ch 7-9), plan_content_d.js (ch 10-12), generate_plan_docx.js (3-section assembler: cover / Roman TOC / Arabic body).
- Generated docx; ran add_toc_placeholders.py --auto (44 headings, exit 0); ran scripts/postprocess_footers.py (patched footer1 ROMAN, footer2 arabic, stripped 1 empty pgNumType).
- Ran postcheck.py: 0 errors, 1 acceptable warning (mandatory TOC PageBreak separator).
- Verified rendering via LibreOffice PDF conversion: 36 pages, cover/TOC/body/tables all clean, no blank pages.

Stage Summary:
- Deliverable: /home/z/my-project/download/Rent_Control_System_Implementation_Plan.docx (36 pages, 12 chapters, ~20 tables incl. 48-item master activity checklist, compliance matrix examples, risk register, owner step-by-step guide, legal traceability summary).
- Noted honestly in document: Directive Art. 22 fine ladder figures partly ambiguous in scanned two-column layout; to be confirmed against official Amharic text at Phase 1 (A-06) and encoded as configurable parameters.
- Next step offered to user: approve plan (Gate G0) and proceed to Phase 1 requirements consolidation (SRS v1.0), or request revisions to the plan.
